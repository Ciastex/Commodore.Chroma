[08:59:13 AM] <optix> you know what i really dont like?
[08:59:24 AM] <optix> headaches in a morning before a test in the 7th lesson
[09:09:33 AM] <cookie> You know what I really dislike
[09:09:37 AM] <optix> what is it
[09:10:12 AM] <cookie> The fact that i have no idea if i live in a simulation or not
[09:10:17 AM] <cookie> It's a constant thought
[09:10:23 AM] <cookie> That just sits in my head
[09:10:29 AM] <cookie> I'm tired of it
[09:10:37 AM] <optix> does it make a difference if you live in a simulation or not tho
[09:10:45 AM] <cookie> It does
[09:10:58 AM] <cookie> If i live in a simulation i do not have to care about others' future because there is no future nor past
[09:11:05 AM] <cookie> Because nothing really exists
[09:11:10 AM] <cookie> It drives me sleepless
[09:11:17 AM] <cookie> I havent slept for days because of this
[09:11:23 AM] <cookie> Like tonight
[09:11:34 AM] <optix> you should visit a psychologist
[09:11:50 AM] <cookie> I was trying to reproduce calculations on this topic
[09:12:01 AM] <cookie> And i am stumped because none of the calculations are proven to be evidence of anything
[09:12:10 AM] <cookie> NOTHING seems to be evidence of anything
[09:13:04 AM] <cookie> I am in a deep scare man
[09:13:12 AM] <cookie> Because i still think we're not real
[09:13:30 AM] <cookie> help.
[09:17:41 AM] <optix> our planet is bound to die at some point, even if we manage to migrate to somewhere else *somehow*, the universe is gonna die at some point, so anything we are working towards is bound to end at some point
[09:17:59 AM] <optix> by that logic it wouldnt matter if we're in a simulation or not
[09:18:10 AM] <optix> it doesnt matter either way
[09:18:30 AM] <cookie> But if it's all real there's a reason to work to build upon it
[09:19:07 AM] <optix> and what would that reason be?
[09:19:32 AM] <optix> to have it fall apart at some point
[09:20:21 AM] <cookie> To...
[09:20:34 AM] <cookie> Fuck, you're a hidden genius
[09:20:40 AM] <cookie> I have an idea...
